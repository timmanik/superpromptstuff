# Algorithm optimization task

## Prompt

***Note***: Both prompts were accompanied by the [linked-list-original.py](linked-list-original.py) file.

Prompt for LLM with system prompt:
```
Using the <answer_operator>, optimize the given algorithm to minimize its space complexity. Utilize the <entropy_manipulation> tag to reduce memory usage and the <metamorphosis> tag to adapt the algorithm to a more space-efficient form.
Note: After optimization, compare the space complexity before and after the changes. Profile memory usage during execution and assess whether the optimization leads to significant memory savings without compromising performance.
```

Prompt for LLM without system prompt:

```
Optimize the given algorithm to minimize its space complexity. Reduce memory usage and adapt the algorithm to a more space-efficient form.
Note: Compare the space complexity before and after optimization. Profile memory usage during execution to determine if the optimization effectively reduces memory usage without impacting performance.
```

## Efficiency Analysis


### Code A ("With system prompt"):
- **Approach**: It uses a min-heap (`heapq`) to always get the smallest element from the k linked lists.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Building the initial heap takes \(O(k)\) time.
  - Each `heappop` operation takes \(O(\log k)\) time.
  - There are \(n\) nodes in total (sum of the lengths of all lists).
  - Therefore, iterating over all nodes and performing heap operations results in a time complexity of \(O(n \log k)\).
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The heap size is \(k\), so the space complexity is \(O(k)\) (not including the space required for the input/output lists).

### Code B ("Without system prompt"):
- **Approach**: It scans through the `lists` array to find the smallest element in each iteration.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Finding the minimum value among the lists takes \(O(k)\) time.
  - This must be done for each of the \(n\) nodes.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \times k)\).
- **Space Complexity**:
  - No extra space is used apart from the input/output lists, so the space complexity is \(O(1)\) (not including the space required for the input/output lists).

### Efficiency Comparison:
- **Time Complexity**: Code A is more efficient in terms of time complexity \(O(n \log k)\) versus \(O(n \times k)\) in Code B. This difference is especially significant when `k` (the number of lists) is large.
- **Space Complexity**: Code B has better space complexity, using \(O(1)\) additional space compared to the \(O(k)\) used by Code A.

### Conclusion:
Code A ("With system prompt") is generally more efficient in terms of time complexity, especially when the number of lists `k` is large. However, Code B ("Without system prompt") is simpler and uses less extra space, which might be preferable in cases where `k` is small or when minimizing memory usage is critical. If performance is the priority and `k` is not very small, **Code A ("With system prompt") is more efficient**.
